# How to use?
1. Create a webhook in your discord server in the channel where you want your reports to get posted.
2. Import the **report.sk** into your scripts folder (located at: plugins -> skript -> scripts).
3. Copy the webhook URL of the integration that you just made and replace `WEBHOOK_URL` with the copied url.
4. Reload the skript by typing `/sk reload report.sk` in game or in the console using `sk reload report.sk`.

# How does it work?
To report someone in-game you can run `/report <player> <reason>` and it should show up in the channel that you have linked with the script.

# Result
This how it should look like after setting up everything correctly
