# How to use?
Import the **report.sk** into your scripts folder (located at: plugins -> skript -> scripts)
Reload the skript by typing **/sk reload report.sk** in game or in the console using **sk reload report.sk**

# What changes do I make?
Before the script is going to work, you will have to create a webhook in the channel you want to send the message to in your discord server.
After you have made the webhook, you need to copy the webhook URL and replace `WEBHOOK_URL` with the webhook URL that you copied from your discord server.
